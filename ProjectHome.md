hato-mta is a Mail Transfer Agent with powerful integrated spam
detection and filtering capabilities.

hato-fetch is a fetchmail replacement and Swiss-Army knife for
managing mail folders.

Documentation of these is available in the manual at

The current development includes many new features and
has been ported to Chicken 4.0, leading towards a 0.4
release hopefully in the near future.

Long term goals will be to switch to the chibi-scheme
module system (which will likely converge with the
upcoming R7RS standard), and to provide converters
from that module system to other Scheme module systems,
so it will no longer be Chicken specific.
