Also sometimes known as Alex Shinn, I'm currently a graduate student
studying computational linguistics at [http://www.naist.jp/ NAIST].
Which is to say, I procrastinate finishing my thesis by hacking
endless side-projects in Scheme.  When the weather is nice I like to
escape the machines and explore the surrounding countryside by car or
road bike.  NAIST is located in Japan's [[wp:Nara Prefecture]],
between [[wp:Osaka]] and [[wp:Kyoto]].

You can contact me at my first and last name at [[wp:Gmail]].  If
you've tried sending mail to the old synthcode.com address, I'm afraid
it's sitting in an archive waiting for me to finish my
[[wp:Spam_(electronic)]] filter.
