Well, I've finally succumbed and started a blog.  This has been on my
list for years now, but naturally I didn't want to use any existing
blogging software so I had to write my own, which meant I needed to
write my own web framework, which meant I needed to rewrite my web
server from scratch again.  In particular, the new margin-based
annotations will make reading and navigation much simpler.{{I have
discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which this margin is too
narrow to contain.}}

Anyway, it's all working now, and hopefully I'll have some interesting
posts to make in the near future.  There are a number of technical
posts I've been wanting to write and simply haven't for lack of a
decent venue, and also want to write about my travels and life in
Japan.  In particular, now that I have a license and

travel is so cheap] here I'm trying to see more of the surrounding
country.

Not that I really care if anyone reads this :) This is all for myself,
as an outlet to rant and to organize my thoughts.
