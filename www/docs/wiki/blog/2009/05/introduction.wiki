Well, I've finally succumbed and started a [[wp:blog]].  This has been
on my todo list for years now, but naturally I didn't want to use any
existing blogging software so I had to write my own, which meant I
needed to write my own web framework, which meant I needed to rewrite
my [[wp:HTTP]] server from scratch (again).  But I'm happy with the new
design, which is even more austere than before, forcing me to focus on
the content itself.  I'm especially happy with the new margin-based
annotations which will make reading and navigation much simpler.{{I
have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which this margin is
too narrow to contain.}}

Anyway, it's basically working now, and hopefully I'll have some
interesting posts to make in the near future.  There are a number of
technical posts I've been wanting to write and simply haven't for lack
of a decent venue, and the first article should be out this evening.
From time to time I may also include some non-technical posts - random
musings on politics of travels or my life in [[wp:Japan]].  In
particular, now that I have a driver's license and highway travel is
so cheap here{{The prime minister has reduced tolls drastically as one
of several steps aimed at stimulating the economy.

I'm trying to see more of the surrounding country.

Enough blabbering... I need to get back to real work!
