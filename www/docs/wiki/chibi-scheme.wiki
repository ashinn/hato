Smaller than TinyScheme, faster than a speeding Guile, able to leap
tall vectors in a single bounds check, with native hygiene to boot!

'''WARNING:''' Do not use Chibi-Scheme!

Seriously, there are real Scheme compilers out there.  The author
of Chibi-Scheme was working on one himself before starting this
silly project, and will likely continue to work on it for years to
come.  But sometimes we all just want to release something.

There seems to be a disturbing trend, however, of people taking
toy Scheme interpreters seriously.  It can't be for ease of use,
because the serious compilers all have the most friendly FFI's.
It can't be for the small memory footprint, because the difference
between a 100k and 2MB program text will be dwarfed by the runtime
memory, and all of the real implementations have much more
efficient memory usage.  But time and again you'll find TinyScheme
crop in in bizarre places, which leads one to wonder how much of a
bad name is Scheme getting by being so often represented by one of
the slowest language implementations on the planet?

So Chibi-Scheme exists as a better toy implementation.  It's a
very small but mostly complete R5RS Scheme implementation using a
reasonably fast custom VM.  Chibi-Scheme tries as much as possible
not to trade its small size by cutting corners, and provides full
continuations, both low and high-level hygienic macros based on
syntactic-closures, string ports and exceptions.  It also has
optional immediate symbols, just to be quirky.
