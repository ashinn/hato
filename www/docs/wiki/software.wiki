These are projects I'm currently actively working on (at least in
spirit, if I don't have the time to actually update them).  Almost all
of this code is written in [[wp:Scheme_(programming_language)]], where
possible in fully portable
[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/ R5RS], otherwise
usually for either [http://call-with-continuation.org/ Chicken] or
[http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/ Gauche].  A number of my modules
are already included directly in Gauche, and the list of Chicken
extensions I've written can be found out at
http://chicken.wiki.br/users/alex-shinn.

* [[chibi-scheme]] - a very tiny Scheme implementation with decent speed and native hygienic macros
* [[scheme-complete]] - intelligent Scheme tab-completion with type-inference for Emacs
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/irregex/ irregex] - a fully portable and efficient R[456]RS implementation of regular expressions
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/hato/doc/hato-manual.html hato] - a mail suite including [[wp:Mail transfer agent]], fetchmail replacement, multilingual spam classifier, Yahoo domain key verifier and other utilities
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/kishi.scm kishi] - a simple chess program with both [[wp:XBoard]] support and an ASCII interface with optional ANSI graphics and Unicode character chess pieces
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/fmt/ fmt] - extensible combinator-based text formatting
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/match.scm match] - a fully portable hygienic pattern matcher backwards compatible with Andrew Wright's MATCH sytax
* [http://synthcode.com/scheme/loop.scm loop] - a powerful and extensible LOOP syntax in the spirit of named-let
